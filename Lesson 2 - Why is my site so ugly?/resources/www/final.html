      "In pretty much every treasure hunting adventure movie there's one specific
      scene in which the plucky hero finally gets his hands on the treasure but
      then has to navigate a maze of booby traps in order to get out alive.
      Temple Run is this scene and nothing else. And it's amazing." -

      From the makers of the award-winning best-seller Harbor Master comes the most
      exhilarating running game on the App Store. Test your reflexes as you race down
      ancient temple walls and along sheer cliffs. Swipe to turn, jump and slide to
      avoid obstacles, collect coins and buy power ups, and see how far you can run!
