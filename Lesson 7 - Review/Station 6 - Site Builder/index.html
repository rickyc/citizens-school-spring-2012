      1. Pour the milk into the mixing bowl and add the pudding mix. Beat with the wire whisk until well blended 
      (about two minutes). Let pudding stand for five minutes. Stir whipped topping and 1/2 of the crushed cookies 
      into the pudding (very gently) with rubber scraper until mixture is all the same color. Place about 1 tablespoon 
      of the remaining crushed cookies into the bottom of each cup.

    <p style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:14px;"> 
      2. Fill cups about 3/4 full with pudding mixture. Top each cup with the rest of the crushed cookies. Add gummy 
      worms and insects to decorate. Put cups into the refrigerator for about one hour to chill them and enjoy!
