          "<b><big>Origami</big></b> (from ori meaning "folding", and gami meaning
          "paper"; kami changes to gami due to rendaku) is the traditional
          Japanese art of paper folding, which started in the 17th century AD
          at the latest and was popularized outside of Japan in the
          mid-1900s. It has since then evolved into a modern art form. The
          goal of this art is to transform a flat sheet of material into a
          finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques, and as
          such the use of cuts or glue are not considered to be origami.
          Paper cutting and gluing is usually considered kirigami.  The
          number of basic origami folds is small, but they can be combined in
          a variety of ways to make intricate designs. The best known origami
          model is probably the Japanese paper crane. In general, these
          designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be
          different colors or prints. Traditional Japanese origami, which has
          been practiced since the Edo era (1603-1867), has often been less
          strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or
          using nonsquare shapes to start with.  The principles of origami
          are also being used in stents, packaging and other engineering
          structures."

          "<b><big>Akira Yoshizawa</big></b> (Yoshizawa Akira; 14 March 1911 â€“ 14 March
          2005) was an origamist, considered to be the grandmaster of origami.
          He is credited with raising origami from a craft to a living art.
          According to his own estimation made in 1989, he created more than
          50,000 models, of which only a few hundred designs were presented as
          diagrams in his 18 books. Yoshizawa acted as an international
          cultural ambassador for Japan throughout his career. In 1983,
          Japanese emperor Hirohito named him to the Order of the Rising Sun,
          one of the highest honors that can be given to a Japanese citizen."
